  * renamed lock filename daemon.lock -> repo.lock
  * now using a flat-file datastore for local blocks

* Fixed lots of bugs
  * proper ipfs-path in various commands
  * fixed two pinning bugs (recursive pins)
  * increased yamux streams window (for speed)
  * increased bitswap workers (+ env var)
  * fixed memory leaks
  * ipfs add error returns
  * daemon exit bugfix
  * set proper UID and GID on fuse mounts

* Gateway
  * Added support for HEAD requests

* configuration
  * env var to turn off SO_REUSEPORT: IPFS_REUSEPORT=false
  * env var to increase bitswap workers: IPFS_BITSWAP_TASK_WORKERS=n

* other
  * bash completion is now available
  * ipfs stats bw -- bandwidth meetering

And many more things.
